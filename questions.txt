Answers to HW8 Questions
==============================================================================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?

    In order to keep track of whether a page has been accessed or not, we need
a flag, which will be 1 if the page has been accessed and 0 if not. Then, we 
set the permission of the page to PROT_NONE. In this way, if the page gets
accessed, a segmentation fault will be reported to the sigsegv handler. If 
this happens, we simply give access permission to the page and set its access
flag to 1, since the page has been accessed. 


b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?

    Similarly to question (a), we need a flag, which will be 1 if the page has
become dirty and 0 if not. This time, we set the page's permission to 
PROT_READ. In this way, if there is an attempt to write in this page, a 
segmentation fault will be reported to the sigsegv handler. Then, we simply
give write permissions to the page and set the dirty flag to 1, since the page
has become dirty.


f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy: 53029


g)  Page Replacement Policy #1 (fill in the information below)

Name of policy you chose to implement: FIFO

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_fifo -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command: 47944

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.


h)  Page Replacement Policy #2 (if you implemented two policies)

Name of policy you chose to implement: CLOCK/LRU

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_clru -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command: 6833

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.

FIFO Implementation: The FIFO queue was implemented as a singly linked list
CLOCK/LRU Implementation: The queue was implemented as a doubly linked list
